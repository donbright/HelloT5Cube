# GLWrapper

This is a lightweight wrapper around OpenGL's GLuint object handles.

## Notes

- Wraps underlying object handle in a type
- Creates object handle
- Destroys object handle when it leaves scope
- **Very Incomplete** Only has functions needed by Hello T5 Cube currently
- **Targets OpenGL 4.6**
